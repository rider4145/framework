what is extent reports
-> configuration to run extent reports (dependencies)
	1. extent reports maven 
	2. testng
	3. selenium -java
	
-> extent reports and extent spark reporter are usefull t generate the reports
	Syntax:
	ExtentReport reports = new ExtentReport();
-> extent spark reporter expects a path where the reports has to be generated
	Syntax:
	String path = System.getProperty("user.dir")+"//reports//index.html";  // path where the reports has to be saved
	ExtentSparkReporter report = new ExtentSparkReporter(path);				// passing the path inside reporter object
	
	
-> declare extent report and extent spark reporter object variables globally to acess over other methods
-> declare create test() in other methods once it is declared, it will monitor the methods and provide reuslt based on method failed or passed
	Syntax:
	reports.createTest("Demo");			// provide test name
-> whenever we createTest() one extent reports will create one object which is unique to test method. 
	The object is responsible to listen and report all the happenigs back to extentreport

-> To notify the test is done we need to use 
	Syntax: reports.flush();
	
	
-> To make the createTest generic to access over all methods. let's use the listeners
